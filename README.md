# Churn Prediction using Machine Learning


Welcome to the Churn Prediction using Machine Learning repository! In this project,
I explored and implemented a churn prediction model using logistic regression.
The goal was to predict customer churn rates based on a variety of features, including customer demographics, 
banking activities, and historical transaction data.

## Overview

Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to understand and anticipate customer behavior.
In this project, I utilized a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
The dataset included various features such as age, gender, occupation, transaction history, and more.

## Features

The dataset contains the following features:

- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `vintage`: Number of days since the customer joined
- `age`: Age of the customer
- `gender`: Gender of the customer
- `dependents`: Number of dependents of the customer
- `occupation`: Occupation of the customer
- `city`: City of the customer
- ... (and more)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction.git

## Usage
Prepare your dataset and place it in the data directory.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the churn prediction model.

Experiment with different features, hyperparameters, or even different algorithms to enhance the prediction accuracy.

## Results

The trained churn prediction model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test dataset. 
Through careful feature engineering and model tuning, we were able to identify key factors contributing to customer churn 
and predict churn events more effectively.
